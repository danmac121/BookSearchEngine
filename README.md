# BookSearchEngine

## Description

With this project, I was attempting to convert this application from it's RESTful API to be a  GraphQL API with apollo server. The queries and mutations for user interaction are currently only functional on the backend. If you were to  clone down this code and install all dependecies, when you run the server if you hit the graphQL endpoint you can see the funcitonality of the site as far as creating/ updating users goes. The api search works on the front end but saving books currently does not.
